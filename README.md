HashTable
=========
Basic implementation of a Generic HashTable in Java
The Hash Table is splittend into buckets wich shortens the search time of a key.
Each pair is inserted into a ceartain bucket and whent the key is searched, it is searched
only into one bucket, not in all the HashMap, the search time becomes constant, from O(n) it becomes O(1).
